"""Causal release times for the notebook's CSEC signals.

nb.csec_signals() assigns a corroboration value to every sample of a voltage event, using the event's
peak depth and the peers' events whose onsets lie within +/-CSEC_DTALIGN. In a live site these
quantities are known only after (i) the site's own event has ended, (ii) CSEC_DTALIGN has elapsed after
the onset (no later peer can still qualify), and (iii) each matched peer's event has ended and its
15-byte descriptor has arrived. avail[i] is the first sample index at which the CSEC value of sample i is
known. Samples outside any event have value 0 and are known immediately. Scores are unchanged; a window
decision is released once every sample in it is known, so CSEC appears as decision delay.
net_delay_samples models a fixed descriptor transport delay (0 = ideal link, stated as an assumption).
